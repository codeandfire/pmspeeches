Namaskar friends, The first session of this decade is commencing today. This decade is very important for the bright future of India. And, therefore, a golden opportunity has come before the nation to fulfill the dreams seen by the freedom fighters fast. There should be proper utilization of this decade and, therefore, there should be discussions and presentation of different views for meaningful results keeping in mind this entire decade. These are the expectations of the country. I am sure that the hope and expectation with which the people of the country have sent all of us to Parliament, we will not shy away from contributing to fulfill the aspirations of the people, by making full use of this sacred place of Parliament and following all the propriety of democracy. I have full faith that all the MPs will make this session more productive. This is also a budget session. Perhaps, for the first time in the history of India it has happened that our Finance Minister had to present four-five mini budgets as separate packages in 2020. That is, the series of mini budgets continued in a way in 2020. And I am confident that this budget will also be seen as a part of the series of those four-five budgets. Once again, I along with all the MPs of both the Houses are committed and will strive to further the message of the Honâ€™ble President under his guidance. Many thanks.
