Excellencies, As I said earlier, the finalization of the BRICS Counter Terrorism Strategy is an important achievement. My suggestion is that our NSAs discuss on a Counter-Terrorism Action Plan. I would also like to thank Mr. Sergei Katyrin, the interim chairman of the BRICS Business Council. The main task of economic integration amongst us will be in the hands of the private sector. My suggestion is that the BRICS Business Council draw a concrete plan to take our bilateral trade to the $500 billion target. I congratulate Mr. Marcos Troyjo for taking over as president of the New Development Bank. NDB’s financing support will be even more useful in the context of COVID.  I am happy that NDB has opened office in Russia. And I hope you will also start your regional office in India next year. I congratulate Mr. Igor Shuvalov for his work on the BRICS Inter-Bank Cooperation Mechanism. It is heartening to note that our development banks have agreed on ‘Principles for Responsible Financing’. The convening of BRICS Women’s Alliance was a special priority for President Putin, and his vision has now been realized. I thank the Alliance’s Chairperson, Ms Anna Nesterova, for her report. We are making several efforts to promote women entrepreneurship in India. It is expected that the Alliance will enhance intra-BRICS cooperation in this field. Once again, I extend warm thanks to all of you, especially our host, Mr. Putin.
