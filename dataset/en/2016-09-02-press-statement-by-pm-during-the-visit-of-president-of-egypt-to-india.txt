President and I held extensive discussions on the shape and substance of our partnership. We have agreed on an action oriented agenda to drive our engagements. Friends,  President and I are of one view that growing radicalization, increasing violence and spread of terror pose a real threat not just to our two countries. But, also to nations and communities across regions. India appreciates the good work that Egypt has been doing during its current term on the UN Security Council. Our decision to consult more closely on regional and global issues, both at the U.N. and outside, will benefit our common interests. We agreed that the U.N. Security Council needs to be reformed to reflect the realities of today. We also welcome Egypt’s participation at next week’s G20 Summit. We believe it will add value and enrich the substance of discussions at G-20. Let me once again extend my warmest welcome to you and your delegation. I wish you and the Egyptian people all success. India stands ready to be a reliable partner in fulfillment of your developmental, economic and security goals.
