Namaskar Friends, This is the last session of 2019, and it is also a very crucial session because this is the 250th session of Rajya Sabha. The 250th session of Rajya Sabha is beginning with very inspiring memories of its journey of 250 sessions. Similarly, during this session, on the 26th, we have our Constitution Day. While we are celebrating 70 years of our Constitution, this Constitution incorporates the unity, integrity, diversity and beauty of India and is the driving force for the country. So through this House70 years of the Constitution can become an opportunity for the countrymen to become awaken. In the past, there has been an opportunity to meet the leaders of almost all the political parties. The last time after the formation of the new government the session witnessed unprecedented achievements due to the active positive role of everyone, due to the cooperation of all the parties and the cooperation of all the honourable MPs. And I take pride in publicly saying that this achievement does not belong to the government; it does not belong to the Treasury Bench; this achievement belongs to the entire House and all the MPs and that is why I once again express my gratitude to all the MPs for their active and positive role, and I hope that this session will also help in speeding up the journey of development of the country. We, from the Parliament, must express the capability of progressing at an equal pace with the world. We want open discussion on all issues. It is necessary to have the best debate. Be it a debate, a discussion, or a dialogue, everyone must put oneâ€™s intelligence to its maximum level and contribute to enrich the discussion of the House. The outcome of that is useful for the bright future of the country. So, with my best wishes to all the MPs, I thank you very much!
