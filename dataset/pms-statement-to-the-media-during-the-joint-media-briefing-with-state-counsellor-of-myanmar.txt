It is indeed a great pleasure for me to welcome Her Excellency Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on her first State Visit to India. Excellency, you are no stranger to the people of India. The sights, the sounds and vibrancy of Delhi are familiar to you.Welcome back, Excellency, to your second home!Excellency, you are an iconic leader. Your clear vision, mature leadership, struggle and eventual success in establishing democracy in Myanmar has inspired people across the world. It is indeed an honour for us to receive you in India. We are also grateful for your participation at the BIMSTEC and the BRICS-BIMSTEC outreach Summit in Goa a couple of days ago. Excellency, Myanmar has commenced a new journey under your able leadership.It’s a journey of hope and much promise. Friends, As close and friendly neighbours, the security interests of India and Myanmar are closely aligned. We have agreed that a close coordination to ensure security in the areas along our border, and sensitivity to each other’s strategic interests, will serve the interests of both our countries. Our societies enjoy a cultural connect that is centuries old. We have offered assistance in restoring pagodas damaged in the recent earthquake in Myanmar. The Archaeological Survey of India will also soon begin work on restoring two old temples and inscriptions of King Mindon and King Baygyidaw in Bodh Gaya.
