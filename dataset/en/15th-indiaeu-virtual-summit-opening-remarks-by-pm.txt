Excellencies, Namaskar! We had to postpone the India-EU Summit that was due in March in view of COVID-19.  The good thing is that today we are meeting through a virtual medium.  First of all, I express my condolences for the loss caused by Corona virus in Europe.  Thanks for your opening remarks.  Like you, I too am committed to deepen and strengthen the relations between India and the EU. We must adopt a long-term strategic perspective for the same. Besides, an action-oriented agenda should be created, which can be implemented within a stipulated time frame.  India and the EU are natural partners.  Our partnership is also useful for peace and stability in the world.  This reality has become even more evident in today’s global scenario. Both sides share universal values ​​like democracy, pluralism, inclusivity, respect for international institutions, multilateralism, freedom and transparency. After COVID-19, new problems have cropped up globally in the economic field.  This requires greater cooperation between the democratic nations. Today, both health and prosperity of our citizens are facing challenges.  There are a variety of pressures on the rules-based international order. Under such circumstances, the India-EU partnership can play a significant role in economic reconstruction, and in building a human-centric and humanity-centric globalisation. Apart from the current challenges, long-term challenges like climate change are also a priority for both India and the EU. In our efforts to increase the use of renewable energy in India, we invite investment and technology from Europe. I hope that through this Virtual Summit our relations will gain momentum. I once again express my pleasure to have got this opportunity to talk to you.
