Excellency, Namaskar! Thank you for your introductory remarks! As you said, I had to postpone my visit to Italy in May due to COVID-19. The good thing is that today we are able to meet through virtual medium. First of all, I along with all the citizens of India empathise for the damage caused by coronavirus in Italy. When other countries in the world were trying to comprehend the coronavirus, you were battling this calamity. You quickly controlled a very difficult situation with complete success and organized the entire country. Italy’s success in those first months of the pandemic inspired us all. Your experiences guided us all. Excellency, Like you, I am also committed to further broadening and deepening the relations between India and Italy.  Your visit to India for the Tech Summit in 2018 and our meeting touched on many aspects and the people of India also developed a new inquisitiveness towards Italy. It is a matter of happiness that there has been a lot of momentum in mutual exchanges after our talks in 2018. I am happy to know that the Italian Parliament has set up the India-Italy Friendship Group last year. I hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome Italian Parliament members to India once the COVID situation improves. Excellency, It’s clear that the COVID-19 pandemic will remain a watershed in history like the Second World War. We all have to adapt ourselves to this new world, the post-Corona world, and have to be prepared in a new way for the challenges and opportunities arising from this. I am confident that our today’s discussions will further strengthen our relations, enhance mutual understanding and help identify new areas of cooperation.
