YourExcellencies and my friends President Xi and President Putin, As the world’s leading economies, exchange of views between us, on the economic, political and security situation of the world is important. Our trilateral meeting today is a useful medium for discussing and coordinating on major global issues. We had exchange of views on many issues in the meeting of our Foreign Ministers in China in February this year. It included promotion of counter-terrorism, international hot-spot issues, reformed multilateralism, climate change and cooperation under RIC. Thank you President Xi. Now I request His Excellency, President Putin for his opening remarks. Thank you President Putin. Disclaimer: PM’s remarks was delivered in Hindi. This is an approximate translation of the speech.
