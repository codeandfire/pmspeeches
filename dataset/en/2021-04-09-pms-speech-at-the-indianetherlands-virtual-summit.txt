Excellency, Greetings and thank you very much for sharing your thoughts. Your party has achieved its fourth consecutive major victory under your leadership. I had immediately congratulated you on Twitter for the same, but today as we are meeting up virtually, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate you once again and wish you all the best! Excellency, Our relations are based on shared values ​​like democracy and the rule of law. Our approach towards global challenges like climate change, terrorism, pandemics is also the same. Convergence is also emerging on our thoughts about new areas like Indo-Pacific resilient supply chains and Global Digital Governance. Today, we will give a new dimension to this bond with our Strategic Partnership on Water. The establishment of a fast track mechanism for promoting investment will also add new momentum to our strong economic cooperation. I am confident that in the post-Covid period many new opportunities will open up in which like-minded countries like ours can increase mutual cooperation. Excellency, The visit of Their Majesties to India in 2019 has given a boost to India-Netherlands relations. I believe that today our Virtual Summit will add further momentum to the relations. Excellency, Just as you mentioned about the Indian diaspora, it is true that a large number of people of Indian origin are living there in Europe, but I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for the care and concern that you have shown to the people of Indian origin in this corona period, in this pandemic. We will also get the opportunity to discuss various issues during the COP-26 as well as the India-EU summit with the European Union.
