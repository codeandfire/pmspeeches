It should make everyone proud that several women, several people belonging to the SC and ST community have taken oath as Ministers. Several new Ministers are children of farmers and also belong to OBC communities: PM It seems some people cannot digest that more women, SC, ST and OBC community members are becoming Ministers: PM Hon’ble Speaker, I thought that there would be an atmosphere of enthusiasm in the House today because a large number of our women MPs have become ministers. I am happy that our Dalit brothers and our scheduled tribe friends have become ministers in large numbers. It should make everyone happy. Hon’ble Speaker, It would have been a pleasure to introduce our fellow MPs in the House who are from agricultural and rural background, belong to socio-economically backward class, OBC communities, and who have been given a berth in the Council of Ministers in large numbers, and everybody would have honored them by thumping the benches. But perhaps some people cannot digest that more Dalits, women, OBC, farmers’ sons have become ministers and they do not allow their introduction. Therefore, Hon’ble Speaker, the newly appointed members of the cabinet should be considered as introduced in the Lok Sabha.
