I am visiting the Republic of Korea at the invitation of President Moon Jae-in. This will be my second visit to the Republic of Korea and my second Summit meeting with President Moon. We had the pleasure of receiving President Moon Jae-in and First Lady Mrs. Kim Jung-sook in India in July last year. My visit to the Republic of Korea is reflective of the importance we both attach to our relationship. We regard the Republic of Korea as a valued friend, a nation with which we have a Special Strategic Partnership. As fellow democracies, India and the ROK have shared values and a shared vision for regional and global peace. As fellow market economies, our needs and strengths are complementary. ROK is an important partner for our ‘Make in India’ initiative as well as in our ‘Start Up India’ and ‘Clean India’ initiatives. Our collaboration in the field of science and technology is encouraging, with our joint research ranging from basic to advanced sciences. Our people to people ties and exchanges, as always, provide the bedrock of our ties of friendship. We were touched by President Moon’s decision to send the First Lady as his special representative at the ‘Deepotsav’ Festival held in Ayodhya last November. The growing depth and variety in our relationship has been accentuated by the harmony between our Act East Policy and ROK’s New Southern Policy. Working together, we are determined to take our relationship forward as a ‘future oriented partnership for People, Prosperity and Peace’. During this visit, apart from my discussions with President Moon, I will meet with business leaders, members of the Indian community as well as eminent persons from all walks of life. I am confident that this visit will help us to further strengthen this important partnership.
